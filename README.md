Using machine learning, a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending service company was input to create a model to train and evaluate loan risk. This information is used to determine if a borrower has good or bad credit.

# Results
**Logistic Regression Model 1:**

-Balanced Accuracy: 94%

-Precision: avg of 93% (high-risk=87%, low-risk=100%) 

-Recall scores: avg of 95% (high-risk=89%, low-risk=100%)


**Logistic Regression Model 2:**

-Balanced Accuracy: 100%

-Precision: avg of 93% (high-risk=87%, low-risk=100%)

-Recall scores: 100%
